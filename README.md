Applied majority voting ensemble method on various SVM kernels on Internet Traffic Classification dataset. 
The sections of this project are-

1. Importing dataset.
2. Treat missing values by finding mean of each attribute i.e., column.
3. Feature scaling using min-max scaler.
4. Feature selection using Extra trees classifier.
6. Splitting dataset into train and test data.
7. Training Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid SVM kernels.
8. Use Majority voting to determine the ideal class of each record.
9. Apply the model on test data.
10. Display results.
